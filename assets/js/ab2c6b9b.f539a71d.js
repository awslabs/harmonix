Harmonix gives you full flexibility on how many accounts, regions, clusters, and environments you want to use as well as which ones are used by which applications. The choice is yours on how many environments you create as well as their scope of use. For example, you can choose to create an Environment for each application or each team, or even for groups of applications.
